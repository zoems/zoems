Have a look at my projects collaborated on. 
The web application 💫*Warm and Furries*💫 took my team of 2 and I 1 week to conceptualize design and produce!
Or checkout the mobile app ✨*Skill-Share*✨ that I and a team of 3 took from idea to product in 2 weeks!

- 🌱 I’m currently developing with Ruby on Rails and deploying with Heroku!
